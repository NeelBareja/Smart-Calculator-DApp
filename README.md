### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- MetaMask wallet browser extension
- Yarn or npm package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd calculator-dapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
