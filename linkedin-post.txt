üöÄ Excited to share my latest project: A Blockchain-Powered Smart Calculator dApp! 

I've developed a modern decentralized calculator application that brings the power of Web3 to everyday calculations. This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be applied to practical, real-world applications.

üîπ Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Seamless MetaMask wallet integration
‚Ä¢ Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
‚Ä¢ Advanced scientific functions (power calculations, square roots)
‚Ä¢ Beautiful, responsive UI with dark/light mode
‚Ä¢ On-chain computation verification

üõ†Ô∏è Built with:
‚Ä¢ Next.js 15 & React 19
‚Ä¢ TypeScript
‚Ä¢ Tailwind CSS
‚Ä¢ Radix UI Components
‚Ä¢ Ethers.js for Web3 integration
‚Ä¢ Solidity smart contracts

This project showcases the intersection of modern web development and blockchain technology, creating a user-friendly interface for performing calculations on the Ethereum blockchain.
